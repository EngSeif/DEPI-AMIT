## Assignments Overview

1. **Grade Calculator**  
   Calculate and display letter grades based on numeric scores.

2. **List Manipulator**  
   Collect numbers from the user and perform aggregate operations like sum, average, min, and max.

3. **Word Counter**  
   Count the frequency of each word in a given sentence.

4. **Prime Number Checker**  
   Determine if a number is prime.

5. **Simple Inventory System**  
   Manage an inventory using dictionary operations with add, remove, view, and exit functionality.

6. **List Comprehension Practice**  
   Practice creating lists with list comprehensions and conditional filtering.

7. **Tuple Operations**  
   Work with tuples, unpacking, and iterating over a list of tuples.

8. **Set Operations**  
   Perform basic set operations such as union, intersection, and difference.

9. **Simple Calculator Function**  
   Implement a calculator function supporting add, subtract, multiply, and divide operations.

10. **User Authentication System**  
    Create a simple username-password authentication system with limited login attempts.

## General Skills and Concepts Tested by These Tasks

### Basic Input/Output and Data Types
- Handling user input (`input()`) and printing results (`print()`).  
- Understanding and working with basic data types like strings, integers, and floats.

### Control Flow and Conditional Logic
- Using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to make decisions based on conditions.  
- Looping constructs (`for` and `while` loops) for repetition and iteration.

### Data Structures
- Working with lists: creation, indexing, appending, iterating, and aggregating data (`sum`, `max`, `min`).  
- Using dictionaries for key-value storage, updating, retrieving, and counting occurrences.  
- Understanding and manipulating tuples as immutable sequences.  
- Using sets for unique collections and performing set operations (union, intersection, difference).

### Functions
- Defining reusable blocks of code with parameters and return values.  
- Breaking down problems into smaller, manageable functions.

### String Manipulation
- Splitting strings into words, searching, and processing text data.  
- Using string methods and understanding case sensitivity.

### List Comprehensions
- Creating new lists efficiently using concise syntax.  
- Applying conditional filtering inside list comprehensions.

### Algorithmic Thinking
- Implementing logical algorithms like prime number checking.  
- Designing systems like simple inventory or authentication using data structures and loops.

### Error Handling & Input Validation (Implicitly)
- Ensuring program stability by validating user input (e.g., checking login credentials, valid grades).  
- Handling special cases such as division by zero or removing more items than exist.

### Basic Arithmetic and Mathematical Operations
- Performing sums, averages, and other calculations to support logic in tasks.

### Iterative Development and Problem Solving
- Combining multiple concepts to build interactive programs (e.g., user authentication with limited attempts, inventory management).
