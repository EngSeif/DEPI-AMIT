# ðŸŽ¯ Task 5: Simple Inventory System

## ðŸ§  Concept Focus

**Dictionaries**, ```while``` loop, ```if```/```elif```/```else```, **dictionary methods** (```get```, ```updating values```).

---

## ðŸ“„ Description

Create a simple inventory system using a dictionary. The dictionary inventory will store items as keys and their quantities as values (e.g., {'apple': 10, 'banana': 5}).
-   Implement a while loop that continuously prompts the user for an action: add, remove, view, or exit.
- If the user types ```add```: Ask for the item name and quantity to add. Update the inventory.
- If the user types ```remove```: Ask for the item name and quantity to remove. Ensure you don't remove more than available. If removing all, delete the item from the dictionary.
- If the user types ```view```: Print the current inventory (all items and their quantities).
- If the user types ```exit```: Break the loop and end the program
