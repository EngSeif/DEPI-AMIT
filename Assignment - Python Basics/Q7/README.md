# ðŸŽ¯ Task 6: Tuple Operations

## ðŸ§  Concept Focus

**Tuples**, **functions returning tuples**, **unpacking tuples**, **basic iteration**.

---

## ðŸ“„ Description

1.	Create a function get_coordinates() that asks the user for an X coordinate and a Y coordinate. The function should return these two coordinates as a tuple (e.g., (x, y)).
2.	In your main program, call get_coordinates() and unpack the returned tuple into two separate variables. Print a message like "The entered coordinates are X: [x_value], Y: [y_value]".
3.	Create a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a person's name and age (e.g., [("Alice", 30), ("Bob", 25), ("Charlie", 35)]). Use a for loop to iterate through this list and print a sentence for each person, like "Alice is 30 years old."
